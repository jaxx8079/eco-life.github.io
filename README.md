Ideas Addressing our Problem Statement:

 - Home Page: Introduction to the app and its purpose.
 - Eco-News: A place where environmental news and trends are posted
 - Reminders and Quick Actions: Allows the user to move between pages and reminders to complete tasks
 - Eco Tracker: Users log daily sustainable actions.
 - Streaks: A counter that encourages users to continue their sustainable lifestyle
 - Daily Challenges: Tasks the user could do daily to improve their sustainable actions
 - Tips & Resources Page: Provide helpful advice and resources.
 - Achievements Section: Track user milestones and progress.
 - Progress Bars: Helps the user track their achievements over time to encourage them to continue their eco-habits
 - Total Eco Stats Dashboard: A place where the user can manage and see an overall summary of their contributions to ecological living
 - Yearly Tracking
 - Community Forum: A place for users to provide feedback and tips on sustainable living. Users would also be able to post their statistics for others to see.
 - Likes/Upvote: An ability to like/upvote excellent tips and tricks from others
 - Favourite/Saving: Allows users to save posts they enjoy or find useful
 - Leaderboards: Global leaderboards that would allow for friendly competition based on the number of sustainable actions taken
 - Interactive Maps: Displays nearby places that would allow for eco-friendly actions (e.g. gardens, recycling centers, eco events)


We believe that the best combination of our ideas would have to be: the home page, the tips and resources page, the eco-tracker, and the 
eco-stats dashboard. The reasoning behind this decision is that we believe that the goal of the app is to motivate more people to do more
ecologically-friendly activities. Therefore, the main focus of the appâ€™s feature would have to be centered around attributes that increase
a user's attention and motivation to perform those actions. Furthermore, the combination of the tips & resources page and the eco-tracker
would provide us the ability to release more complex tasks as the users would be able to find information related to their daily mission 
through the tips & resources page. As for logistical challenges, we have considered that we only have a total of one month and a half to 
complete the entirety of the app. Therefore, we chose to cut out most of the features that would only slightly increase the potential 
ability of the app to motivate users. For example, people would feel more inclined to maintain a streak instead of hunting for all of the 
achievements as they would have to only complete one task a day instead of potentially having to finish a long tree of missions to get one achievement. 
In conclusion, we believe that these four features are the most important and main characteristics of our app that we need to implement to work towards our goals.
