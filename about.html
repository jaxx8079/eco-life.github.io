                        With Eco-Life, we sought to create an eco-friendly environment through the power of technology and community.<br><br>
                        Created in 2025, this interactive website informs users about environmental information and inspires them to forge their own path in ecological stewardship through fun, habit-building activities.<br><br>
                        Eco-Life also brings people together. Like-minded individuals across the globe can interact and meet with one another to keep the Earth clean and safe for this generation and future ones.<br><br>
                        The Eco-Life project has grown to 100,000 daily users and has been recognized by the James Kasey foundation for motivating ecological thinking and practices.
